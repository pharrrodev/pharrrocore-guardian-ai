# Weekly Client Report Generation Cron Job Setup

This file explains how to set up automated weekly client report generation for the security management system.

## Purpose
Generate comprehensive weekly client reports every Monday at 08:00, combining the previous week's KPI data and daily incident summaries into professional PDF reports.

## Cron Schedule
```bash
# Run weekly client report generation every Monday at 08:00
0 8 * * 1 /path/to/node /path/to/your/project/dist/scripts/weeklyClientReport.js
```

## Alternative Scheduling Options

### Using PM2 (Recommended for Node.js apps)
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

Where ecosystem.config.js contains:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'weekly-client-report-generator',
    script: './dist/scripts/weeklyClientReport.js',
    cron_restart: '0 8 * * 1',
    watch: false,
    autorestart: false
  }]
}
```

### Using systemd timer (Linux)
Create a service file and timer to run the weekly report generation every Monday at 08:00.

### Manual Testing
You can manually trigger the weekly client report generation by running:
```bash
node dist/scripts/weeklyClientReport.js
```

## Data Sources
The script automatically compiles data from:
- `/reports/kpi-YYYY-MM-DD.json` (Daily KPI compliance metrics)
- `/reports/summary-YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (Daily incident summaries)

## Report Generation Process
1. **Week Calculation**: Determines the previous Monday-Sunday ISO week range
2. **Data Collection**: Loads all available KPI and summary files for that week
3. **Analysis**: Calculates weekly averages and compliance metrics
4. **Markdown Generation**: Creates structured report with:
   - Executive summary with key metrics
   - Daily KPI breakdown table
   - Incident highlights from daily summaries
   - Operational notes and recommendations
5. **PDF Export**: Converts markdown to professional PDF format

## Output Files
- **Markdown**: `/reports/client-weekly-YYYY-WWW.md`
- **PDF**: `/reports/client-weekly-YYYY-WWW.pdf`

Where:
- YYYY = Year (e.g., 2024)
- WWW = ISO week number (e.g., W12)

## Report Content Structure
Each weekly report includes:
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of the week's security operations
- **KPI Dashboard**: Daily breakdown of patrols, breaks, uniform compliance
- **Incident Analysis**: Highlights from daily incident summaries
- **Compliance Assessment**: Performance against security standards
- **Operational Recommendations**: Areas for improvement or commendation

## PDF Generation Dependencies
For production deployment, install one of these packages:
```bash
# Option 1: Puppeteer (recommended)
npm install puppeteer

# Option 2: Markdown-PDF
npm install markdown-pdf

# Option 3: wkhtmltopdf wrapper
npm install wkhtmltopdf
```

## Error Handling
- Missing KPI files: Day is skipped, report continues with available data
- Missing summary files: Day marked as "No summary available"
- No data for entire week: Generates report indicating no data collected
- PDF generation failure: Falls back to markdown-only report

## Client Delivery
Generated PDF reports are professional-grade documents suitable for:
- Client monthly/quarterly reviews
- Compliance audits
- Performance assessments
- Contract renewals
- Stakeholder presentations

## Customization Options
The report template can be customized for:
- Company branding and logos
- Specific KPI requirements
- Custom incident categorization
- Additional metrics or charts
- Multi-language support

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Console logs track successful generation
- Failed generations can trigger email alerts
- Report availability notifications to management
- File size and content validation checks
