# No-Show Alert Cron Job Setup

This file explains how to set up automated no-show checking for the security rota system.

## Purpose
Run the no-show check script every 5 minutes to automatically detect when guards fail to check in for their shifts within the grace period (default: 10 minutes).

## Cron Schedule
```bash
# Run no-show check every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /path/to/node /path/to/your/project/dist/scripts/noShowCheck.js
```

## Alternative Scheduling Options

### Using PM2 (Recommended for Node.js apps)
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

Where ecosystem.config.js contains:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'noshow-checker',
    script: './dist/scripts/noShowCheck.js',
    cron_restart: '*/5 * * * *',
    watch: false,
    autorestart: false
  }]
}
```

### Using systemd timer (Linux)
Create a service file and timer to run the check every 5 minutes.

### Manual Testing
You can manually trigger the no-show check by running:
```bash
node dist/scripts/noShowCheck.js
```

## Environment Variables
- `GRACE_PERIOD_MINUTES`: Number of minutes after shift start to wait before alerting (default: 10)

## Integration Notes
- The script reads from rota-data.json (built by Rota Builder)
- Checks against logs/shiftStart.csv (written by EDOB when guards log "Shift Start")
- Outputs alerts to logs/noShowAlerts.csv
- Console logs serve as placeholders for future SMS/email notifications

## Monitoring
Check the No-Show Dashboard in the web application to view all alerts and their status.
